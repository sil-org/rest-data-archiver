# Running rest-data-archiver as a Lambda process

This rda application is a good use case for Serverless operation. As a primarily 
scheduled job, running it in a Serverless/Lambda environment is a great way to
reduce infrastructure overhead.

### Important warning

This application is configured using a `config.json` file that may include
secrets. Be sure not to store this file in a public repository. 

## Setup

The contents of this `lambda-example` directory are intended to be copied to
your own filesystem and repository. In this directory are a couple files for use
with [Codeship](https://codeship.com). If you don't use Codeship you can remove
them and replace them with whatever is appropriate for your CI/CD provider. 

After downloading the files, copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and
edit as needed. Also copy `.env.example` to `.env` and insert AWS credentials
for Serverless to use to deploy the Lambda function. 

Due to dependencies on Go to build the application and Serverless to interact
with AWS to create and deploy the Lambda the easiest way to do all this is using
the included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose`.

Run `make deploy`. This will build the Docker image, run `go get` inside the
container, build the Go binary, and use Serverless to deploy the Lambda function
to the default Serverless stage `dev`, but you can update the command in the
Makefile to change the stage as desired. 

If you want to automate deployment with Codeship, encrypt the `.env` file to 
`.env.encrypted` and connect your private project repo with Codeship. By
default, it is configured to only deploy _production_ when changes are pushed to
the main branch.
